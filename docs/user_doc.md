To refine your search, the left container provides four filters:

## User Interaction

The effectiveness of the Document Search Tool relies not only on its advanced search capabilities but also on how documents are authored and how users formulate their search queries. Adhering to best practices ensures that the search results are relevant and accurate.

### Writing Searchable Documents

To ensure that subsections within your documents are effectively searchable, it's essential to adhere to a specific format that aligns with the capabilities of the Document Search Tool. The following guidelines outline the necessary criteria for creating searchable subsections:

- **Clear and Meaningful Headings**: Every subsection intended to be searchable must be accompanied by a clear and meaningful heading. It's important to note that simply increasing the font size of regular text in applications like Google Docs does not suffice to create a heading. Utilize the built-in heading formatting options provided by the document editor to designate a section as a proper heading. This ensures that the tool can accurately break down the content into distinct segments for indexing.
- **Section Introduction**: Enhance the search accuracy by including a brief introductory segment at the beginning of each subsection. These introductory lines should concisely summarize the content of the section. This contextual information aids the search algorithm in establishing accurate matches between user queries and section content.
- **User-Relatable Language**: Craft your document using language that resonates with potential user search queries. Aim to incorporate terms, phrases, and keywords that are likely to be used by users seeking the information contained in your document. This approach increases the relevance of search results and enhances the overall search experience.

### Crafting Effective Search Queries

Crafting well-defined search queries significantly impacts the quality of search results:

- **Specificity**: Be as specific as possible in your query. Include keywords related to the topic you're searching for within the document.
- **Contextual Information**: If applicable, include context in your query. Mention any relevant headings, topics, or keywords to narrow down your search.
- **Phrasing**: Phrase your query in a way that mirrors how you would naturally ask a question. This helps the tool understand your intent more accurately.
- **Filters**: Utilize document type filters if you're looking specifically for content within Google Docs or Markdown files.
- **Experimentation**: If you're not getting desired results, consider rephrasing your query or trying different keywords to improve search accuracy.
  By adhering to these guidelines when creating documents and crafting search queries, users can enhance the search experience and access the most relevant sections quickly.
