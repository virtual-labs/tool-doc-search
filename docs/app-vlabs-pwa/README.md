**_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Virtual Labs PWA</span>_**

## Overview:

This app displays all experiments hosted under the Virtual Labs site. It allows users to filter and search for experiments that interest them. The app is also a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) and which means that the app is mobile-compatible and can run completely offline.

The app has also been converted to an [APK](<https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/APK-file-Android-Package-Kit-file-format#:~:text=An%20APK%20file%20(Android%20Package%20Kit%20file%20format)%20is%20the,Android%20operating%20system%20(OS).>) and hosted on the android play store. The app works seamlessly and due to using MUI Joy in combination with React, the app looks and feels like a native Android app.

The PWA has been deployed to ‘[https://app.vlabs.ac.in](https://app.vlabs.ac.in/)’
