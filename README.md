# Virtual Labs Document Search

## Introduction

The Document Search Tool for Virtual Labs is designed to alleviate the challenges associated with navigating vast collections of documents within the virtual labs environment. This tool serves as a powerful solution to efficiently retrieve relevant sections from a plethora of documents, ensuring that users can access the information they need promptly.

## Target Audience

The Virtual Labs Document Search Tool is tailored for two primary user groups:

### 1. Document Searchers

This category includes users who seek specific information within the virtual labs environment. Document Searchers may be students, researchers, or anyone looking for precise sections within a multitude of documents. They benefit from the tool's advanced search capabilities and user-friendly interface, allowing for efficient retrieval of relevant information.

### 2. Document Managers

Document Managers are responsible for adding and managing documents within the database. Typically, these users have administrative roles and need to ensure that the database is up-to-date. Document Managers log in with their Google credentials to access the Insert Page, where they can update existing documents, delete outdated entries, and add new documents to enhance the searchability of the tool.
